## Intent
Pass data with multiple attributes in one shot from client to server,
to avoid multiple calls to remote server. 


## Applicability
Use the Data Transfer Object pattern when

* The client is asking for multiple information. And the information is related.
* When you want to boost the performance to get resources.
* You want reduced number of remote calls.
