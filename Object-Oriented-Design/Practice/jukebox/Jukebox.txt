Design a musical juke box using object oriented principles. 


Let’s first understand the basic system components:

- CD player
- CD
- Display () (displays length of song, remaining time and playlist) 


Now, let’s break this down further:

- Playlist creation (includes add, delete, shuffle etc sub functionalities) CD selector
- Track selector
- Queueing up a song
- Get next song from the playlist


A user can also be introduced 

- Adding 
- Deleting 
- Credit info

How do we group this functionality based on Objects (data + functions which go together)?
