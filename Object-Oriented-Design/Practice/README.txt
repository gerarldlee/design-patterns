EDX EPFL: NEURAL DYNAMICS - COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENECE OF SINGLE NEURONS

The activity of neurons in the brain and the code used by these neurons is
described by mathematical neuron models at different levels of detail.



SYLLABUS

Week 1: A first simple neuron model

Week 2:  Hodgkin-Huxley models and biophysical modeling

Week 3: Two-dimensional models and phase plane analysis

Week 4: Two-dimensional models (cont.)/ Dendrites

Week 5: Variability of spike trains and the neural code

Week 6: Noise models, noisy neurons and coding

Week 7: Estimating neuron models for coding and decoding

Library of data objects that simulate mathematical neurons, for now just theta neurons
with synaptic coupling and adaptation currents. Future releases should include classic
Hodgkin-Huxley neurons.
