Creational design patterns
==========================

Most common are:
1. Singleton - creation of one and only instance alone.
2. Factory - delegation of the creation of objects to its subclasses instead of directly implementing in the compositing class.
3. Abstract Factory - and how it differs with Factory.
4. Builder - separates or parses the construction of a complex object from its representation so that it can create different representation
5. Prototype - makes an object a prototypical instance to create new objects. essential in Javascript
